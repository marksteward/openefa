#summary Summary of EFA's architecture

= Introduction =

EFA consists of a number of XML generators and XSLT transforms.

The URLs are of the form:
http://site.tld/frontend/SERVICE?param=value&param=value

= [Support] =

Please note that this documentation is a collation of what can be found in the public domain.  Nobody involved in EFA has provided any information here, and they have no obligation to make the system behave as described here.  They also do not provide support for this documentation: if something doesn't work, please [http://code.google.com/p/openefa/issues/list raise an issue] on OpenEFA.

== [Services] ==

For every REQUEST service, there are two basic forms: XML_SERVICE_REQUEST and XSLT_SERVICE_REQUEST.  Each service is probably a Java servlet, which uses passed back parameters to change session state.  There is also XSDM_SERVICE_REQUEST, but this doesn't appear to be used properly yet.

= [Frontends] =

Frontends are probably just a different set of XSLTs.  For example, the TFL has /bcl/ to generate high-visibility pages and /lite/ to provide JSON output.
